# ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start

##### `Run tests`

-   cd src
-   Use https://smartpy.io/ide to create individual contracts for each file in this folder
-   cd ../mocks
-   use these files as test NFT and FT contracts and create their own individual contracts following the naming convention used in test files
-   cd ../tests
-   every file in this folder is an extensive test file for their respective use cases, copy paste in smartpy ide as independant contract and run
-   Details of the entire tests suit can be found [**here**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/141I0AZj9HZwbpGhcaKmDdEXhe4gPTlnE_hUvZTQqD4o/edit?usp=sharing)
